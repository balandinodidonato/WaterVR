# WaterVR

WaterVR, a Pd patch which allows the user to interact with water within a virtual environment using the XthSense device. This path has been realised for the [Xth Sense Creative Lab](http://www.xth.io/mixed-reality-with-the-xth-sense/) at Integra Lab in February 2016. For more info please visit xth.io or contact me.
